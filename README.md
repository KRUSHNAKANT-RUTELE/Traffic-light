Traffic Light Project – Description

The Traffic Light Project is a simple web-based project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It simulates a real-life traffic signal system on a webpage.
The interface shows three lights — red, yellow, and green — styled with CSS to look like a traffic signal. 
JavaScript is used to control the lights so they turn on and off in a sequence, just like real traffic lights. 
Each light glows for a few seconds before switching to the next one.
